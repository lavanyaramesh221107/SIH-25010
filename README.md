## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Theme
Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development

## Proposed Solution
SmartCrop+ is a data-driven, multilingual, and offline-compatible advisory platform designed to help small and marginal farmers make smarter decisions regarding crop selection, pest management, irrigation, fertilization, and marketing. It uses AI/ML, weather APIs, soil data, satellite imagery, and mobile technology to deliver personalized, real-time agricultural advice.

## Technical Approach
 1.Data Collection
• IoT Sensors – Monitor soil moisture, pH, temperature, and humidity.
• Weather & Satellite Data – Collect rainfall, temperature, and climate forecasts.
• Farmer Inputs – Crop preferences, land size, and local conditions.

 2.Data Processing
• Cloud/Server Storage – Centralized storage of collected data.
• AI/ML Analysis – Predict optimal crops, irrigation schedules, fertilizer usage, and detect pest/disease risks.

 3.Advisory Generation
• Generate recommendations on crop selection, sowing time, irrigation, fertilizer, and pest management.

## Feasibility and Viability
Proven Technologies: All components (AI, satellite data, mobile app, SMS) are technically feasible and already in use in isolated agri-solutions.

Modular Design: System is designed to be modular and scalable, so additional crops or languages can be added easily.

Open APIs: Leverages open APIs (e.g., OpenWeather, Agmarknet) to reduce development cost and time

## Impact and Benefits
Impact

• Increases crop yield through data-driven recommendations.
• Optimizes use of water, fertilizers, and pesticides.
• Reduces crop losses due to pests, diseases, and adverse weather.
• Empowers farmers to make informed decisions.

Benefits

• Higher income and reduced input costs.
• Saves time and labor by providing automated advisories.
• Promotes sustainable and eco-friendly farming practices.
• Accessible via mobile, SMS, or voice in local languages.
• Improves market access by suggesting the right crops and harvest time.

## Research and References
Research from organizations like the FAO, World Bank, and IFPRI shows that digital farming solutions improve yields, cut resource use, and support smallholder farmers in adapting to climate change. Studies in agricultural journals highlight how IoT-based systems boost efficiency, while industry reports, such as those from McKinsey, emphasize the economic and sustainability benefits of AgriTech, reinforcing the value of platforms like AgriSage.
