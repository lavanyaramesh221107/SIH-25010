## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

##Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

##Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

##Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

##Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

##Proposed Solution
A Smart Crop Advisory System tailored for small and marginal farmers aims to provide affordable, localized, and timely agricultural guidance using digital technologies. The system would be mobile-based, with both smartphone and feature phone compatibility, ensuring accessibility across varying literacy and connectivity levels. Multilingual support, voice-based commands, and SMS/USSD interfaces would make it usable even for farmers without smartphones or internet access.

At the core of the system would be an AI-powered crop recommendation engine that analyzes inputs like soil type, historical crop data, weather forecasts, and market demand to suggest the most suitable crops for a particular season and region. The platform would also provide real-time weather updates and pest/disease alerts, leveraging data from meteorological departments and satellite sources to help farmers prepare and act proactively. Additionally, farmers would be able to use smartphone cameras or portable soil testing kits to diagnose crop health and receive instant AI-generated recommendations on fertilizers or treatments.

To further support farmers economically, the system would offer market linkage features, displaying up-to-date information about nearby mandis, input suppliers, and prevailing crop prices, while also facilitating collective selling through FPOs and cooperatives. A built-in chatbot—accessible through WhatsApp or the mobile app—would assist farmers with frequently asked questions, voice-enabled support, and practical guides, helping overcome barriers related to literacy or lack of extension services.

##Technical Approach
1. Data Collection
   IoT Sensors: Soil moisture, pH, temperature, humidity.
   Satellite/Weather APIs: Rainfall, climate forecasts.
   Farmer Input: Crop preference, local conditions.

2.Data Processing (Backend System)

   Cloud/Server stores and integrates all data.
   AI/ML models analyze soil, weather, and crop data.
   Decision Support System generates crop recommendations.

3.Advisory Generation

  Suggests suitable crops, sowing time, fertilizer, and irrigation needs.
  Provides pest/disease alerts.

4. Communication to Farmers

   Mobile App/SMS/IVR in local language.
   Simple visuals & voice-based advisory for non-literate farmers.

## Feasibility and Viability
The Smart Crop Advisory System is technically feasible because it uses readily available technologies like IoT sensors, AI, and cloud computing. It can operate effectively in rural areas through mobile networks and provides advisories in local languages, making it easy for farmers to use.

Economically, the system is viable as it helps farmers increase their income by improving crop yield and reducing input costs. Efficient use of water, fertilizers, and pesticides also supports sustainable farming practices.

The system is scalable and adaptable, allowing expansion to other regions and crops with minimal changes. Its continuous updates and AI-driven learning ensure long-term effectiveness and benefits for small and marginal farmers.

## Research and References
Advanced AI Integration:
      Researchers at IIIT-Allahabad developed an AI-based technology for real-time crop disease detection, achieving a detection success rate of up to 97.25%. This system utilizes a combination of AI, IoT, deep learning, and federated learning to analyze crop health through leaf images and environmental data. 


Government Initiatives:
      The Maharashtra government has approved a Rs 500 crore initiative, the 'MahaAgri-AI Policy 2025-2029', aimed at integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and modern technologies into agriculture. This program will utilize tools like drones, smart sensors, and mobile apps to provide real-time data to farmers, enhancing the technical feasibility of smart crop advisory systems.
